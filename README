Installation
============

  cd /path/todir/where/you/keep/code
  git clone git://github.com/jefferis/MatlabSupport.git

Now add /path/todir/where/you/keep/code/MatlabSupport to your Matlab path

Adding more packages
====================

If you want to add a new matlab package (or other code)

1) make a new directory for the code (removing any version numbers)
2) include the original license if it exists
3) make sure that your git converts any Windows CRLF to LF on checkin. I have set the text attribute for most common source code files in .gitattributes.  
4) git add all the files you want.
4a) think about whether you want to add compiled mex files. The default is to ignore them and this is preferred unless they were very difficult to compile for some reason.
5) git commit with a sensible message including version number of package

License
=======

All code obviously retains the license/copyright of the original authors.
